# Checkers in Python

## About
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts):
>Draughts or checkers is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces.

I have an idea to improve my understanding in AI by modifying the checkers game from another repo and improve the AI using minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning optimizatizion. This is also my group project in AI class. 

## Installation and usage
1. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/`.
2. [Activate](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#activators) the virtual environment if you don't have pygame installed on your machine.
3. Run `python checkers.py`
